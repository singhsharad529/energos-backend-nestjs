# Backend Application for Blog Site using NestJs

This is a RESTful API example based on Nestjs and MongoDB, following the **MVC pattern** i.e. Model ~~View~~ Controller.

**Mongoose** is used for Database transactions which is an elegant solution to mongodb object modeling for Nestjs.

This repository contains a Nestjs application that implements Rest APis for Blogs using MongoDB Atlas.
